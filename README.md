Project Details
Problem Statement
The goal of this project is to develop a system that predicts the need for mental health intervention based on text input and real-time emotion analysis from video. This system aims to assist in identifying individuals who might need professional counseling based on their textual expressions and emotional states.

Code Overview
Data Loading and Preprocessing:

Load two datasets: survey.csv and reddit_mental_health.csv.
Combine these datasets, preprocess the text data by removing stop words and lemmatizing the words.
Assign labels for mental health treatment requirements.
Text Preprocessing:

Use NLTK and spaCy for text preprocessing, including stop words removal and lemmatization.
Model Training and Saving:

Convert text data into numerical features using TF-IDF Vectorizer.
Define and train a Sequential neural network model with dense and dropout layers to predict the need for mental health treatment.
Save the trained model and the TF-IDF vectorizer for future use.
Model Loading and Prediction:

Load the saved model and TF-IDF vectorizer.
Predict whether an individual needs mental health intervention based on new text input.
Recommend intervention based on the prediction result.
Real-time Emotion Analysis:

Use the FER package to detect emotions from live video captured via a webcam.
Display the predominant emotion on the video frames.
Algorithms Used
TF-IDF Vectorization:

Convert text data into numerical features that represent the importance of words in the documents.
Neural Networks:

Sequential Neural Network: A feedforward neural network used for binary classification of whether mental health intervention is needed.
Types of Neural Networks Used
Sequential Neural Network:
Dense Layers: Fully connected layers with ReLU activation functions for feature extraction.
Dropout Layers: Used to prevent overfitting by randomly dropping neurons during training.
Output Layer: A single neuron with a sigmoid activation function for binary classification.
Problem Statement
Develop a system to predict the need for mental health intervention based on text data and real-time emotion analysis from video. The system should:

Preprocess and combine text data from multiple sources.
Train a machine learning model to predict mental health intervention needs.
Use a neural network for the prediction task.
Analyze live video feed to detect and display emotions.
This project aims to provide a tool that can help in early identification of individuals who might benefit from mental health services, using both textual and visual data inputs.
